Electronics Sales Report Dashboard – Power BI
This Power BI project is focused on analyzing and visualizing sales data for electronics products. The main goal of this dashboard is to help businesses make data-driven decisions by understanding product performance, regional trends, and customer behavior.

•	Filters to view data by month, year, or specific time ranges
•	Analysis of top-performing and low-performing products
•	Region-wise sales breakdown with map visualizations
•	Customer segment analysis to understand buying patterns
•	Easy-to-use slicers and dropdowns for interactive insights

What I learned
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Power BI, especially in designing clean dashboards, working with multiple data views. I also gained experience in presenting business insights in a way that’s easy for non-technical users to understand.
